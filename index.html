    <h1> Astropy Tutorials</h1>
        <p>The tutorials on this site walk through some typical software tasks and demonstrate the features in Astropy sub-packages in the context of a story or standard workflow. See the <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/">Astropy documentation</a> for a structured view of the functionality within the Astropy project.</p>

    <h2>List of Tutorials</h2>
    <ul>
<li><a href='UVES.html''>Analyzing UVES Spectroscopy with Astropy</a><br/><span>This tutorial demonstrates the data analysis of MN Lup obtained with the UVES spectrograph on the VLT.</span></li>
<li><a href='FITS-header.html''>Editing a FITS header</a><br/><span>Demonstrates how to read in, edit a FITS header, and then write it back out to disk using astropy.io.fits.</span></li>
<li><a href='edshift_plot.html''>Making a plot with both redshift and universe age axes</a><br/><span>Demonstrates how to make a plot with both redshift and universe age axes, using astropy.cosmology and matplotlib.</span></li>
<li><a href='plot-catalog.html''>Read and plot catalog information from a text file</a><br/><span>Demonstrates use of astropy.io.ascii for reading and writing ASCII data, astropy.coordinates and astropy.units for converting RA (as a sexagesimal angle) to decimal degrees, and matplotlib for making a color-magnitude diagram and on-sky locations in a mollweide projection.</span></li>
<li><a href='Quantities.html''>Using Astropy Quantities for astrophysical calculations</a><br/><span>Demonstrates use of the astropy.units, astropy.constants, and the Quantity object for calculating the mass of a galaxy from its velocity dispersion and determining masses of molecular clouds from CO intensity maps. Includes use of matplotlib for making a histogram and an image with a colorbar. Also includes good practices for using quantities in functions you might distribute to other people.</span></li>
<li><a href='Coordinates.html''>Using astropy.coordinates to Match Catalogs and Plan Observations</a><br/><span>Demonstrates use of astropy.coordinates for common tasks. Includes matching catalogs against each other, basic observing planning tasks, and basic usage of coordinates.</span></li>
<li><a href='FITS-images.html''>Viewing and manipulating FITS images</a><br/><span>Demonstrates use of astropy.utils.data to download data; astropy.io.fits to open the file; matplotlib to view the image with different color scales and stretches and to make histrograms. Also includes method for simple image stacking.</span></li>
<li><a href='FITS-tables.html''>Viewing and manipulating data from FITS tables</a><br/><span>astropy.utils.data to download the file, astropy.io.fits to open and view the file, matplotlib for making both 1D and 2D histograms of the data.</span></li>
    </ul>
