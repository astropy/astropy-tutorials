    "In this tutorial, we will use the examples of the Planck function and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) to illustrate how to integrate numerically, using the trapezoidal approximation and Gaussian quadrature. We will also explore making a custom class, an instance of which is callable in the same way as a function. In addition, we will encounter `astropy`'s built-in units, and get a first taste of how to convert between them. Finally, we will use $\\LaTeX$ to make our figure axis labels easy to read."
