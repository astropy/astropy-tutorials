Examples
========

Examples are stand-alone code snippets that live in the astropy documentation that demonstrate a specific functionality within a package.
Examples don't provide conceptual background/context or exhaustive explanation of the functionality being demonstrated.
Examples have less explanation, they may prompt questions which can be answered by scrolling up and down into the documentation.

See the `Astropy Examples <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/index.html>`_ for a structured view of the examples within the Astropy project.
