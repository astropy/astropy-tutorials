It's most powerful use is in fact to transform data from one map projection to another without losing any information and still properly conserving flux values within the data. It even has a method to perform a fast reprojection if you are not too concerned with the absolute accuracy of the data values. \n",

    "\n",

These can be created manually if you wanted to completely change something about the projection type (i.e. going from a Mercator map projection to a Tangential map projection). For us, since we want to match our resolutions, we can just \"steal\" the WCS object from the HI data. Specifically, we will be using the [reproject_interp()](https://reproject.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/reproject.reproject_interp.html#reproject.reproject_interp) function.
