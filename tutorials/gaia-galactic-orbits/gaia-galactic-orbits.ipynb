    "We will use data from the [Gaia mission](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia) to get sky positions, distances (parallaxes), proper motions, and radial velocities for a set of stars that are close to the Sun. We will then transform these observed, heliocentric kinematic measurements to Galactocentric Cartesian coordinates and use the positions and velocities as initial conditions to compute the orbits of these stars in the galaxy using the [gala](http://gala.adrian.pw) Python package. We will compare the orbits of high-mass main sequence (i.e. young) stars to the orbits of lower-mass main sequence stars to show that young stars have smaller vertical amplitudes."

    "\n",
    "[The Gaia mission](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/) is an ESA mission that aims to measure the 3D positions and velocities of a large number of stars throughout the Milky Way. The primary mission objective is to enable studying the formation, structure, and evolutionary history of our Galaxy by measuring astrometry (sky position, parallax, and proper motion) for about 2 billion stars brighter than the Gaia $G$-band photometric magnitude $G \\lesssim 21$. By end of mission (~2022), Gaia will also provide multi-band photometry and low-resolution spectrophotometry for these sources, along with radial or line-of-sight velocities for a subsample of about 100 million stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "In April 2018, Gaia publicly released its first major catalog of data — data release 2 or DR2 — which provides a subset of these data to anyone with an internet connection. In this tutorial, we will use astrometry, radial velocities, and photometry for a small subset of DR2 to study the kinematics of different types of stars in the Milky Way."

We'll use data exclusively from [data release 2 (DR2)](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-release-2) from the *Gaia* mission. For the demonstration here, let's grab data for a random subset of 4096 stars within a distance of 100 pc from the Sun that have high signal-to-noise astrometric measurements.\n",

    "To perform the query and to retrieve the data, we'll use the *Gaia* module in the [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gaia/gaia.html) package, `astroquery.gaia`.

We don't need all of the columns that are available in DR2, so we'll limit our query to request the sky position (`ra`, `dec`), parallax, proper motion components (`pmra`, `pmdec`), radial velocity, and magnitudes (`phot_*_mean_mag`). More information about the available columns is in the [Gaia DR2 data model](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GDR2/Gaia_archive/chap_datamodel/sec_dm_main_tables/ssec_dm_gaia_source.html). \n",

We used the colors and absolute magnitudes of these stars to select subsamples of high- and low-mass stars, which, on average, will provide us with subsamples of stars that are younger and older, respectively. We then constructed a model for the gravitational field of the Milky Way and numerically integrated the orbits of all stars in each of the two subsamples. Finally, we used the orbits to compute the maximum height that each star reaches above the Galactic midplane and showed that the younger (higher-mass) stars tend to have smaller excursions from the Galactic plane, consistent with the idea that stars are either born in a \"thinner\" disk and dynamically \"heated,\" or that older stars formed with a larger vertical scale-height."

Use the zmax values to select a few of these stars and plot their full orbits. Do these stars look like they are part of the disk? Why / why not?\n",
