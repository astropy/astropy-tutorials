    "There are a few things we need to know about the FITS format so I will collect them there. And if you are either now, or in the future, wondering \"why is it like that\" the answer is that the FITS format was originally designed and optimised for magnetic tape. This means that the FITS format was originally designed for sequentual reading rather than random access, so the FITS format has no index (listing at what bytes various parts of the file start) but instead is formatted in 2880 byte chunks so that a tape reader head can simply skip forward by 2880 bytes repeatedly and check if a new section has begun. This is mostly trivia for us as modern users, but there are a few implications. Firstly, when reading FITS files the Astropy FITS module by default reads them \"lazily\" meaning that it does not tabulate all the extensions until it needs to (i.e. when the user requests a specific extension or calls the `info()` function). Secondly, and most crucially for this tutorial, when creating FITS extension manually, the most critical part of creating a new *valid* FITS extension is making sure the number of bytes is a multiple of 2880. These are of course but a few of the quirks of the FITS format, to read about all of them in their full and eccentric glory, see the [FITS standard](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_standard.html) document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A short review of terminology:**\n",
    "- The basic block of a FITS file is called a Header Data Unit (HDU).\n",
    "- Each HDU contains two elements, the header and the data.\n",
    "- A FITS file consistes of one or more HDUs.\n",
    "- Astropy represents a FITS file as an HDUList, where each extension is an HDU of a specific type (i.e PrimaryHDU, ImageHDU, etc).\n",
    "- For more details see the [Astropy FITS Documentation](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/)."
