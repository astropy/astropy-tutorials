    "Adam Ginsburg, Eric Koch\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "* reproject a cube spectrally\n",
    "* smooth it spectrally\n",

    "## Keywords\n",
    "spectral cube, radio astronomy, astroquery, units, dask\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Spectroscopic cube observations taken at different wavelength can trace the motion of gas or stars using spectral lines, but often lines at different wavelengths give different information.\n",
    "For example, one might observe a galaxy in the 21cm line of HI and the 115 GHz line of CO, or a protoplanetary disk in a line of N2H+ and a line of CO, or a galactic disk in the H-alpha and H-beta lines (in absorption or emission).\n",
    "In order to compare these data sets pixel-by-pixel, they must be placed onto a common grid with common resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to take two spectral cubes observed toward the same part of the sky, but different frequencies, and put them onto the same grid using [spectral-cube](spectral-cube.readthedocs.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/) to obtain line frequencies from [splatalogue](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/splatalogue/splatalogue.html); this example uses radio-wavelength data for which Splatalogue's molecular line lists are appropriate.\n",
    "Finally, it shows how to do the reprojection using [dask](https://dask.org) to enable parallelization."
