    "In this tutorial we present some examples showing how Astropy's `Quantity` object can make astrophysics calculations easier. The examples include calculating the mass of a galaxy from its velocity dispersion and determining masses of molecular clouds from CO intensity maps. We end with an example of good practices for using quantities in functions you might distribute to other people.\n",
