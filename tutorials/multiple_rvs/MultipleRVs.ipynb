    "# Summary\n",
    "It is a common task in astronomy to calculate a final measured quantity (and error) when there are multiple individual measurements for a particular object. If the measurement errors are similar in magnitude, one might choose an error weighted average. In other cases where there are large and small error bar it may be better to simply use the quantity corresponding to the lowest error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often the case when dealing with radial velocities (RVs) for stars, which (as the name suggests) measures the velocity in the line-of-sight of the observer (positive value are receeding from the observer). In the era of large spectroscopic surveys such as RAVE, Gaia DR2 (soon to be DR3) and GALAH, correct RV measurements are crucial to properly interpret data for millions of stars. When combined with positions, proper motions (the angular displacement on the sky per year) and distance measurements, a full 6D spatio-kinematic map of the star can be produced. Three examples of how RV measurements can be utilised are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine membership status for candidate members of comoving clusters and groups.\n",
    "2. Traceback the orbits of stars through the Galaxy\n",
    "3. reveal the large-scale kinematic structure of the Milky Way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also know that approximately half of all stars belong in multiple systems, and depending on their orbital properties (e.g., physical separation, eccentricity, inclination), their multiplicity status is given away by the fact that the components vary in RV, typically between 1-100 km/s. Whilst obvious temporal changes in RV are a giveaway for identifying multiples, it should be noted there is always some (usually small) probability that multiple systems evade detection because they are observed at the same orbital phase!\n",
    "\n",
    "### With this in mind, the following program:\n",
    "\n",
    "- reads in a table of RV measurements for any set of stars\n",
    "- makes a decision on whether the star is multiple or likely single\n",
    "- calculates a final RV from the individual measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some points before we begin:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Table rows consist of a star identifier (that must be exactly the same if multiple entries are present), a reference to the source catalogue, the RV, and the RV error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the cases where no RV error is calculated (tut, tut), for lack of a better method, we have assumed this error to be twice the median error bar from the whole sample of RV measurements. It is the user's discretion whether or not to include data that are missing errors (but sometimes even these measurements have intrinsic value if, say, there are no other measurements).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The confidence placed in the reliability of each RV measurement is equal regardless of provenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The physical maximum RV difference for an equal mass binary system is $\\Delta RV_{\\rm max} \\geq 437\\times\\frac{\\sqrt{M/M_{\\odot}}}{\\sqrt{a/R_{\\odot}}}$ km/s -- [Bowers & Deeming 1984](https://adswww.harvard.edu/abs/1984astr.book.....B). We discard these RV outiers from analysis when considering the multiplicity status and measuring the final RV."
