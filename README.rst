Astropy Tutorials
=================

This repository contains tutorials for the `Astropy <http://astropy.org>`_
project. These are typically longer-form, more narrative presentations of
functionality in the `Astropy core package
<https://github.com/astropy/astropy>`_ and any `affiliated packages
<http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`_. The tutorials are therefore
different from the `Astropy core package documentation
<http://docs.astropy.org>`_, which presents a more structured and exhaustive
view of the core package.

To see the tutorials rendered as static web pages, see the `Astropy tutorials
site <http://tutorials.astropy.org>`_.

To run the tutorials interactively, you'll need to make sure you have `Jupyter
notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ installed, then clone or download this
repository. The notebook files themselves live in the ``tutorials`` directory
of this repository, organized by the names of the tutorials.

You can also get started quickly using `Binder <http://mybinder.org>`_ to run the tutorials in
your web browser within a remote server:
