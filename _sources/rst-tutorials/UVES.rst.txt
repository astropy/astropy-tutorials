This tutorial follows our real-life data analysis of MN Lup and the code
developed below is taken (with only minor modifications) from the code
that we used to prepare the publication. The plots that we will develop
below appear in very similar form in the article published in `ApJ, 771,
1, 70 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...771...70G>`__.

The examples below depend on each other and the plots in the last
section make use of things calculated in the earlier sections. Thus, if
you need to restart your python session in the course of this tutorial,
please execute all the code again.

Before you proceed
------------------

.. code:: python

    # Set up matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline

Download the tar file and extract the files by executing the python code
below. Executing this block will download and extract a tar file with
data necessary for this tutorial. By default it will run in whatever
directory you have placed this notebook. If that’s some place you don’t
want to fill with data files, change the ``working_dir_path`` variable.


:inputnumrole:`In[2]:`


.. code:: python

    import tarfile
    from astropy.utils.data import download_file
    url = 'http://data.astropy.org/tutorials/UVES/data_UVES.tar.gz'
    f = tarfile.open(download_file(url, cache=True), mode='r|*')
    working_dir_path = '.'  # CHANGE TO WHEREVER YOU WANT THE DATA TO BE EXTRACTED
    f.extractall(path=working_dir_path)

Scientific background
---------------------

In this tutorial we analyze data from MN Lup, a T Tauri star in the
Taurus-Auriga star forming region located at a distance of about 140 pc.
MN Lup has been observed simultaneously with XMM-Newton and the UVES
spectrograph on the VLT. MN Lup is suspected to be a classical T Tauri
star, that is accreting mass from a circumstellar disk. MN Lup has been
Doppler imaged by `Strassmeier et
al. 2005 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...440.1105S>`__ with a
very similar UVES setup and those authors claim an rotationally
modulated accretion spot.

In the X-ray data we find moderate indications for accretion. In this
tutorial we analyze (some of) the UVES data to search for rotationally
modulated features in the emission line profiles, which could be due to
an accretion spot on the stellar surface.

Reading the data
----------------

A previous Astropy tutorial already covered `handling FITS
files <../FITS-header.html>`__ and WCS transformations, so the
explanation here is only very brief. Check the `astropy
documentation <http://docs.astropy.org>`__ or the other two tutorials
for more details:


:inputnumrole:`In[3]:`


.. code:: python

    from glob import glob
    import os
    
    import numpy as np
    
    from astropy.wcs import WCS
    from astropy.io import fits
    
    # os.path.join is a platform-independent way to join two directories
    globpath = os.path.join(working_dir_path, 'UVES/*.fits')
    
    print(globpath)
    # glob searches through directories similar to the Unix shell
    filelist = glob(globpath)
    
    # sort alphabetically - given the way the filenames are
    # this also sorts in time
    filelist.sort()


:outputnumrole:`Out[3]:`


.. parsed-literal::

    ./UVES/*.fits


Read the first FITS file in the list and check what is in there:


:inputnumrole:`In[4]:`


.. code:: python

    sp = fits.open(filelist[0])
    sp.info()


:outputnumrole:`Out[4]:`


.. parsed-literal::

    Filename: ./UVES/r.UVES.2011-08-11T232352.266-A01_0000.fits
    No.    Name      Ver    Type      Cards   Dimensions   Format
      0  PRIMARY       1 PrimaryHDU     609   (42751,)   float32   


We see that the data is given as the primary image and all other info is
part of the primary header. So, we can extract the WCS from that header
to get the wavelength coordinate. If you see warnings about a
non-standard RADECSYS, don’t worry about this – the WCS will still work,
it just doesn’t fully conform to the WCS standard.


:inputnumrole:`In[5]:`


.. code:: python

    header = sp[0].header
    
    wcs = WCS(header)
    #make index array
    index = np.arange(header['NAXIS1'])
    
    wavelength = wcs.wcs_pix2world(index[:,np.newaxis], 0)
    wavelength.shape
    #Ahh, this has the wrong dimension. So we flatten it.
    wavelength = wavelength.flatten()

The flux is contained in the primary image.


:inputnumrole:`In[6]:`


.. code:: python

    flux = sp[0].data

Making code reusable as a function
----------------------------------

Now, we don’t want to repeat this process for every single file by hand,
so let’s define a function that takes the filename as input and returns
the wavelength and flux arrays and the time of the observation. In
python, functions are created with the ``def`` statements. All lines
that have an indentation level below the ``def`` statement are part of
the function. Functions can (but do not have to) return values using the
``return`` statement.

If a function ``func`` is contained in a file called
``spectra_utils.py`` in the current directory, then this file can be
imported into a python session in order to use the function ``func``
with the following command:

``import spectra_utils a = spectra_utils.func(param1, param2, ...)``

Alternatively, you can import just one (or a few) of many different
functions that are defined in your file ``spectra_utils.py``:

``from spectra_utils import func a = func(param1, param2, ...)``

You’ll recognize that python does not make a difference between modules
that come with python (e.g. ``glob``), external modules (e.g. ``numpy``
or ``astropy``) and modules that you write yourself. The syntax to
import those modules or functions is the same in all cases, provided
that the directory where your module is defined is in the search path
`more about python modules and the search
path <http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html>`__.

Once you used ``import spectra_utils`` python will not monitor the
source file. If you change the source code of ``func`` in the file,
you’ll need to ``reload(spectra_utils)`` to load the new version of
``func``.

So, after all this discussion, we can now define a function that
automates the loading of a single spectrum using the commands we
developed above. Even if this function is fairly short, we still add
some documentation to the header, so that we can look up what parameters
it needs when we come back to this project a while later. We like to
comment every function that is longer than two lines.

The UVES pipeline that was used to reduce the data that we use in the
this example employs a fixed wavelength grid (see exercise above), thus
the ``wavelength`` is the same for all spectra. This makes it easy to
define an array that can hold the fluxes of all observations. Then, we
loop over the list of all filenames and fill this array with data.


:inputnumrole:`In[10]:`


.. code:: python

    flux = np.zeros((len(filelist), len(wavelength)))
    # date comes as string with 23 characters (dtype = 'S23')
    date = np.zeros((len(filelist)), dtype = 'U23')
    
    for i, fname in enumerate(filelist):
        w, f, date_obs = read_spec(fname)
        flux[i,:] = f
        date[i] = date_obs

Units and constants in astropy
------------------------------

Often, one has to keep track of the units for certain values. Was the
wavelength given in Angstrom or in nm? In X-ray observations, a common
unit of wavelength is keV. How many nm is 0.65 keV?
```astropy.units`` <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html>`__
offers a framework that can take care of this book-keeping and propagate
the units through many (but not all) mathematical operations
(e.g. addition, division, multiplication). Furthermore,
```astropy.constants`` <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/constants/index.html>`__
supplies the values of many physical and astronomical constants. The
easiest way to attach a unit to a number is by multiplication.


:inputnumrole:`In[11]:`


.. code:: python

    import astropy.units as u
    from astropy.constants.si import c, G, M_sun, R_sun
    
    wavelength = wavelength * u.AA
    
    # Let's define some constants we need for the exercises further down
    # Again, we multiply the value with a unit here
    heliocentric = -23. * u.km/u.s
    v_rad = -4.77 * u.km / u.s  # Strassmeier et al. (2005)
    R_MN_Lup = 0.9 * R_sun      # Strassmeier et al. (2005)
    M_MN_Lup = 0.6 * M_sun      # Strassmeier et al. (2005)
    vsini = 74.6 * u.km / u.s   # Strassmeier et al. (2005)
    period = 0.439 * u.day      # Strassmeier et al. (2005)
    
    inclination = 45. * u.degree # Strassmeier et al. (2005)
    # All numpy trigonometric functions expect the input in radian.
    # So far, astropy does not know this, so we need to convert the
    # angle manually
    incl = inclination.to(u.radian)

Now we can use those variables in our calculations. MN Lup is a T Tauri
star (TTS), which is possibly surrounded by an accretion disk. In the
spectra we’ll be looking for signatures of accretion. We expect those
accretion signatures to appear close to the free-fall velocity v that a
mass m reaches, when it hits the stellar surface. We can calculate the
infall speed using simple energy conservation.

.. math:: E_{kin}  =  E_{grav}

.. math:: \frac{1}{2} m v^2  =  G \frac{m M_*}{R_*}

So, let’s calculate the free-fall velocity for MN Lup.


:inputnumrole:`In[12]:`


.. code:: python

    v_accr = (2.* G * M_MN_Lup/R_MN_Lup)**0.5 
    print(v_accr)
    # Maybe astronomers prefer it in the traditional cgs system?
    print(v_accr.cgs)
    # Or in some really obscure unit?
    from astropy.units import imperial
    print(v_accr.to(imperial.yd / u.hour))


:outputnumrole:`Out[12]:`


.. parsed-literal::

    504329.2809002659 m / s
    50432928.09002659 cm / s
    1985548350.0010464 yd / h


How does the accretion velocity relate to the rotational velocity?


:inputnumrole:`In[13]:`


.. code:: python

    v_rot = vsini / np.sin(incl)
    v_accr / v_rot


:outputnumrole:`Out[13]:`




.. math::

    4780.3573 \; \mathrm{\frac{m}{km}}



Oh, what is that? The seconds are gone, but ``astropy.quantity`` objects
keep their different length units unless told otherwise.


:inputnumrole:`In[14]:`


.. code:: python

    (v_accr / v_rot).decompose()


:outputnumrole:`Out[14]:`




.. math::

    4.7803573 \; \mathrm{}



The reason for this is that it’s not uncommon to use different length
units in a single constant, e.g. the Hubble constant is commonly given
in “km/ (s Mpc)”. “km” and “Mpc” are both units of length, but generally
you do *not* want to shorten this to “1/s”.

We can now use the ``astropy.units`` mechanism to correct the wavelength
scale to the heliocentric velocity scale.

:math:`\lambda_{heliocentric} = \lambda_{bariocentric} * (1 + \frac{v_{helio}}{c})`

We could try:


:inputnumrole:`In[15]:`


.. code:: python

    wavelength = wavelength * (1. + heliocentric/c)

However, this fails, because ``heliocentric/c`` is in units of “km/m”
and ``1.`` is just a number. From the notation above, it is not clear
what we actually want. Do we ask for the value of
``heliocentric/c + 1.`` or do we want to simplify the units of
``heliocentric/c`` and after that add ``1.``? There are several ways to
make the instruction precise, but one is to explicitly add
``u.dimensionless_unscaled`` to ``1.`` to tell astropy that this number
is dimensionless and does not carry any scaling.


:inputnumrole:`In[16]:`


.. code:: python

    wavelength = wavelength * (1. * u.dimensionless_unscaled+ heliocentric/c)

We want to mention one more feature here (check out
```astropy.units`` <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html>`__
for more): The ability to convert the spectral axis to frequencies or
energies. Normally, a unit of length is not equivalent to a unit of
energy or to a frequency, but this conversion makes sense for the
wavelength of a spectrum. This is how it can be done:


:inputnumrole:`In[17]:`


.. code:: python

    wavelength.to(u.keV, equivalencies=u.spectral())
    wavelength.to(u.Hz, equivalencies=u.spectral())


:outputnumrole:`Out[17]:`




.. math::

    [8.0341357 \times 10^{14},~8.0340719 \times 10^{14},~8.0340081 \times 10^{14},~\dots,~5.9971542 \times 10^{14},~5.9971186 \times 10^{14},~5.9970831 \times 10^{14}] \; \mathrm{Hz}



Exercise
~~~~~~~~

Spectroscopically, MN Lup is classified as spectral type M0 V, thus the
gravitational acceleration on the surface :math:`\log(g)` should be
comparable to the sun. (For non-stellar astronomers: Conventionally, all
values are given in the cgs system. The value for the sun is
:math:`\log(g) = 4.4`.)

Calculate :math:`\log(g)` for MN Lup with the values for the mass and
radius given above. Those values were determined from evolutionary
tracks. Check if the :math:`\log(g)` is consistent with the value
expected from spectroscopy.

The values from evolutionary tracks are indeed consistent with the
spectroscopically estimated surface gravity.

Exercise
~~~~~~~~

Write a function that turns a wavelength scale into a velocity scale. We
want to input a wavelengths array and the rest wavelength of a spectral
line. We need this function later to show the red- and blueshift of the
spectrum relative to the the Ca II H line. Use the following definition
to make sure that the code below can use it later. You can test if your
function works by calculating the Doppler shift of the following
wavelengths relative to :math:`H_\alpha`.


:inputnumrole:`In[19]:`


.. code:: python

    waveclosetoHa = np.array([6562.,6563,6565.]) * u.AA

        w_equiv = w.to(u.km/u.s, equivalencies=w0_equiv)
        return w_equiv

Exercise
~~~~~~~~

Write a function that takes a wavelength array and the rest wavelength
of a spectral line as input, turns it into a Doppler shift (you can use
the function from the last exercise), subtracts the radial velocity of
MN Lup (4.77 km/s) and expresses the resulting velocity in units of
vsini. We need this function later to show the red- and blueshift of the
spectrum relative to the Ca II H line. Use the following definition to
make sure the that code below can use it later.


:inputnumrole:`In[21]:`


.. code:: python

    def w2vsini(wavelength_array, wavelength_line):
        # .. replace this with your implementation ..
        return array_of_shifts_in_vsini


:inputnumrole:`In[22]:`


.. code:: python

    def w2vsini(w, w0):
        v = wave2doppler(w, w0) - 4.77 * u.km/u.s
        return v / vsini

Converting times
----------------

```astropy.time`` <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/time/index.html>`__
provides methods to convert times and dates between different systems
and formats. Since the ESO FITS headers already contain the time of the
observation in different systems, we could just read the keyword in the
time system we like, but we will use ``astropy.time`` to make this
conversion here. ``astropy.time.Time`` will parse many common input
formats (strings, floats), but unless the format is unambiguous the
format needs to be specified (e.g. a number could mean JD or MJD or
year). Also, the time system needs to be given (e.g. UTC). Below are
several examples, initialized from different header keywords.


:inputnumrole:`In[23]:`


.. code:: python

    from astropy.time import Time
    t1 = Time(header['MJD-Obs'], format = 'mjd', scale = 'utc')
    t2 = Time(header['Date-Obs'], scale = 'utc')

Times can be expressed in different formats:

.. parsed-literal::

    <Time object: scale='tt' format='mjd' value=55784.97567650852>



Times can also be initialized from arrays and we can calculate time
differences.


:inputnumrole:`In[26]:`


.. code:: python

    obs_times = Time(date, scale = 'utc')
    delta_t = obs_times - Time(date[0], scale = 'utc')

Now we want to express the time difference between the individual
spectra of MN Lup in rotational periods. While the unit of ``delta_t``
is days, unfortunately ``astropy.time.Time`` and
``astropy.units.Quantity`` objects don’t work together yet, so we’ll
have to convert from one to the other explicitly.


:inputnumrole:`In[27]:`


.. code:: python

    delta_p = delta_t.value * u.day / period

Normalize the flux to the local continuum
-----------------------------------------

In this example we want to look at the time evolution of a single
specific emission line in the spectrum. In order to estimate the
equivalent width or make reasonable plots we need to normalize the flux
to the local continuum. In this specific case the emission line is
bright and the continuum can be described reasonably by a second-order
polynomial.

So, we define two regions left and right of the emission line, where we
fit the polynomial. Looking at the figure, ``[3925*u.AA, 3930*u.AA]``
and ``[3938*u.AA, 3945*u.AA]`` seem right for that. Then, we normalize
the flux by this polynomial.

The following function will do that:


:inputnumrole:`In[28]:`


.. code:: python

    def region_around_line(w, flux, cont):
        '''cut out and normalize flux around a line
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        w : 1 dim np.ndarray
        array of wavelengths
        flux : np.ndarray of shape (N, len(w))
        array of flux values for different spectra in the series
        cont : list of lists
        wavelengths for continuum normalization [[low1,up1],[low2, up2]]
        that described two areas on both sides of the line
        '''
        #index is true in the region where we fit the polynomial
        indcont = ((w > cont[0][0]) & (w < cont[0][1])) |((w > cont[1][0]) & (w < cont[1][1]))
        #index of the region we want to return
        indrange = (w > cont[0][0]) & (w < cont[1][1])
        # make a flux array of shape
        # (number of spectra, number of points in indrange)
        f = np.zeros((flux.shape[0], indrange.sum()))
        for i in range(flux.shape[0]):
            # fit polynomial of second order to the continuum region
            linecoeff = np.polyfit(w[indcont], flux[i, indcont], 2)
            # divide the flux by the polynomial and put the result in our
            # new flux array
            f[i,:] = flux[i,indrange] / np.polyval(linecoeff, w[indrange].value)
        return w[indrange], f
    
    wcaII, fcaII = region_around_line(wavelength, flux,
        [[3925*u.AA, 3930*u.AA],[3938*u.AA, 3945*u.AA]])

Publication ready output
------------------------

Tables
~~~~~~

We’ll calculate the equivalent width in Angstroms of the emission line
for the first spectrum.


:inputnumrole:`In[29]:`


.. code:: python

    ew = fcaII[0,:] - 1.
    ew = ew[:-1] * np.diff(wcaII.to(u.AA).value)
    print(ew.sum())


:outputnumrole:`Out[29]:`


.. parsed-literal::

    20.2123821447853


Using ``numpy`` array notation we can actually process all spectra at
once.


:inputnumrole:`In[30]:`


.. code:: python

    delta_lam = np.diff(wcaII.to(u.AA).value)
    ew = np.sum((fcaII - 1.)[:,:-1] * delta_lam[np.newaxis, :], axis=1)

Now we want to generate a LaTeX table of the observation times, period
and equivalent width that we can directly paste into our manuscript. To
do so, we first collect all the columns and make an
``astropy.table.Table`` object. (Please check
```astropy.table`` <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/table/index.html>`__
or ``tabular-data`` for more details on ``Table``). So, here is the
code:


:inputnumrole:`In[31]:`


.. code:: python

    from astropy.table import Column, Table
    from astropy.io import ascii
    
    datecol = Column(name = 'Obs Date', data = date)
    pcol = Column(name = 'phase', data = delta_p, format = '{:.1f}')
    ewcol = Column(name = 'EW', data = ew, format = '{:.1f}', unit = '\\AA')
    tab = Table((datecol, pcol, ewcol))
    # latexdicts['AA'] contains the style specifics for A&A (\hline etc.)
    tab.write(os.path.join(working_dir_path, 'EWtab.tex'), latexdict = ascii.latexdicts['AA'])

Plots
~~~~~

We’ll make two plots. The plotting is done with
```matplotlib`` <http://matplotlib.org>`__, and does not involve Astropy
itself. Plotting is introduced in ``plotting-and-images`` and more
details on plotting can be found there. When in doubt, use the search
engine of your choice and ask the internet. Here, we mainly want to
illustrate that Astropy can be used in real-live data analysis. Thus we
don’t explain every step in the plotting in detail. The plots we produce
below appear in very similar form in Guenther et al. 2013 (ApJ, 771,
70).

In both cases we want the x-axis to show the Doppler shift expressed in
units of the rotational velocity. In this way, features that are
rotationally modulated will stick out between -1 and +1.


:inputnumrole:`In[32]:`


.. code:: python

    x = w2vsini(wcaII, 393.366 * u.nm).decompose()

First, we’ll show the line profile.


:inputnumrole:`In[33]:`


.. code:: python

    # set reasonable figsize for 1-column figures
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
    ax.plot(x, fcaII[0,:], marker='', drawstyle='steps-mid')
    ax.set_xlim([-3,+3])
    ax.set_xlabel('line shift [v sin(i)]')
    ax.set_ylabel('flux')
    ax.set_title('Ca II H line in MN Lup')
    # when using this interface, we need to explicitly call the draw routine
    plt.draw()


:outputnumrole:`Out[33]:`

Exercise
~~~~~~~~

The plot above shows only a single spectrum. Plot all spectra into a
single plot and introduce a sensible offset between them, so that we can
follow the time evolution of the line.

There are clearly several ways to produce a well-looking plot. Here is
one way:


:inputnumrole:`In[34]:`


.. code:: python

    yshift = np.arange((fcaII.shape[0])) * 0.5
    #shift the second night up by a little more
    yshift[:] += 1.5
    yshift[13:] += 1
    
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
    
    for i in range(25):
        ax.plot(x, fcaII[i,:]+yshift[i], 'k')
    
    #separately show the mean line profile in a different color
    ax.plot(x, np.mean(fcaII, axis =0))
    ax.set_xlim([-2.5,+2.5])
    ax.set_xlabel('line shift [$v \\sin i$]')
    ax.set_ylabel('flux')
    ax.set_title('Ca II H line in MN Lup')
    fig.subplots_adjust(bottom = 0.15)
    plt.draw()


:outputnumrole:`Out[34]:`



.. image:: nboutput/UVES_93_0.png



Next, we’ll make a more advanced plot. For each spectrum we calculate
the difference to the mean flux.


:inputnumrole:`In[35]:`


.. code:: python

    fmean = np.mean(fcaII, axis=0)
    fdiff = fcaII - fmean[np.newaxis,:]

In the following simple plot, we can already see features moving through
the line. However, the axis scales are not right, the gap between both
nights is not visible and there is no proper labeling.


:inputnumrole:`In[36]:`


.. code:: python

    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
    im = ax.imshow(fdiff, aspect = "auto", origin = 'lower')


:outputnumrole:`Out[36]:`



.. image:: nboutput/UVES_97_0.png



In the following, we’ll plot the spectra from both nights separately.
Also, we’ll pass the ``extent`` keyword to ``ax.imshow`` which takes
care of the axis.


:inputnumrole:`In[37]:`


.. code:: python

    ind1 = delta_p < 1 * u.dimensionless_unscaled
    ind2 = delta_p > 1 * u.dimensionless_unscaled
    
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
    
    for ind in [ind1, ind2]:
        im = ax.imshow(fdiff[ind,:], extent = (np.min(x), np.max(x), np.min(delta_p[ind]), np.max(delta_p[ind])), aspect = "auto", origin = 'lower')
    
    ax.set_ylim([np.min(delta_p), np.max(delta_p)])
    ax.set_xlim([-1.9,1.9])
    plt.draw()


:outputnumrole:`Out[37]:`



.. image:: nboutput/UVES_99_0.png



Now, this plot is already much better, but there are still some things
that can be improved:

-  Introduce an offset on the y-axis to reduce the amount of white
   space.
-  Strictly speaking, the image shown is not quite the right scale
   because the ``extent`` keyword gives the edges of the image shown,
   while ``x`` and ``delta_p`` contain the bin mid-points.
-  Use a gray scale instead of color to save publication charges.
-  Add labels to the axis.

The following code addresses these points.


:inputnumrole:`In[38]:`


.. code:: python

    # shift a little for plotting purposes
    pplot = delta_p.copy().value
    pplot[ind2] -= 1.5
    # image goes from x1 to x2, but really x1 should be middle of first pixel
    delta_t = np.median(np.diff(delta_p))/2.
    delta_x = np.median(np.diff(x))/2.
    # imshow does the normalization for plotting really well, but here I do it
    # by hand to ensure it goes -1,+1 (that makes color bar look good)
    fdiff = fdiff / np.max(np.abs(fdiff))
    
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
    
    for ind in [ind1, ind2]:
        im = ax.imshow(fdiff[ind,:],
        extent = (np.min(x)-delta_x, np.max(x)+delta_x,
        np.min(pplot[ind])-delta_t, np.max(pplot[ind])+delta_t),
        aspect = "auto", origin = 'lower', cmap = plt.cm.Greys_r)
    
    ax.set_ylim([np.min(pplot)-delta_t, np.max(pplot)+delta_t])
    ax.set_xlim([-1.9,1.9])
    ax.set_xlabel('vel in $v\\sin i$')
    ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(plt.MaxNLocator(4))
    
    def pplot(y, pos):
        'The two args are the value and tick position'
        'Function to make tick labels look good.'
        if y < 0.5:
            yreal = y
        else:
            yreal = y + 1.5
        return yreal
    
    formatter = plt.FuncFormatter(pplot)
    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
    ax.set_ylabel('period')
    fig.subplots_adjust(left = 0.15, bottom = 0.15, right = 0.99, top = 0.99)
    plt.draw()


:outputnumrole:`Out[38]:`

Exercise
~~~~~~~~

Understand the code for the last plot. Some of the commands used are
already pretty advanced stuff. Remember, any internet search engine can
be your friend.

Clearly, we didn’t develop this code for scratch. The `matplotlib
gallery <http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html>`__ is our preferred place
to look for plotting solutions.
